# ArenaLink: A Next-Gen sports experience
Welcome to my first Swift Project. Sumbission for Swift Student Challenge 2023.

## Introduction

If have been to a sports event before you would have experienced being part of a human wave or even a tifosi. Human waves are don't have much variety, it is the same thing again and again. 
Revolutionizes fan interactions in sports venues through making the use of Tifos accessible. An entire interactive screen made up of thousands of phones at the disposal of event organisers.
Works at any type of stadium as long as seats are in rows and seat numbers are assigned. This is not a fully developed, polished product. It is only a proof-of-concept.
